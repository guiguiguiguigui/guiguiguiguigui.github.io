## The Town
I'm at Bombay Beach for [brahman.ai](https://brahman.ai), [Gene](https://genekogan.com)'s initiative for living and learning in the californian desert. I came here with the intention to [write about ml](https://ml4a.github.io) and to build robots.

Bombay Beach is maybe best known by its [Biennale](http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org), a town-wide art festival with tints of post-apocalyptic aesthetics. The Biennalie's artifacts resonate really well with the people and landscape here, making BB a crusty, magical-realist, and overall very charming town. 

I'd love to give you a little tour here, but that has to wait until I develop & scan my films. For now, here's a sneak peek.

### Feb.9 - storm-proofing mars

Mars is another Brahman site in the desert east of Bombay Beach. The structures shown below is _portal_ (a glimpse into the building process [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7eYyg0Ba1K/)), in which we plan to host a party next Saturday. 

<video src="./assets/img/bbd/2-4.mp4" width="500"  class='center' controls preload></video>

&nbsp;

The evening's work was to protect the structure and the 48 TVs inside it. The TVs were donated by a hotel in Manhattan after its renovation. These pictures were taken on the second day, as we were rushing to cover as many area possible before sundown.

### Feb.10 - 3d printing and network security

The storm alert turned out to be a false alarm, but I nonetheless stayed in and learned to do some 3D printing from [Alejandro](https://github.com/alejandrosame).

Who doesn't want to learn about network security and incidence response on a Monday night? With the d20s, we played two rounds of [b&b](http://www.backdoorsandbreaches.com/). 


### Feb.11 - norman and sunset spins

![norman]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/4-1.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Breaking news: Norman napped next to me today*

At the [machine creativity workshop](https://neurips2019creativity.github.io/) at NeurIPS 2019, the band YACHT recited some lyrics from their new album, [Chain Tripping](https://yacht.bandcamp.com/album/chain-tripping). They worked with [Ross Goodwin](https://rossgoodwin.com) and used (my guess is) an recurrent neural net to generate the melodies and lyrics, picked and stitched from these materials, and created a production that (well deservedly) received a Grammy nomination. Anyway, these few lines were stuck in my head for the months that followed, and I want to share them with you. 

> I’m so in love I can feel it in my car  
> I  can feel it in my heart  
> I  can feel it so hard  
> (...)  
> 
> Oh,  won't you come, won't you come  
> Won’t you work on my head  
> Be  my number nine 
>  
> To be alive, to be with you, like a weed  
> 
> I can feel it in my head  
> Like a dog in bed
{: class="smaller"}

The last two lines is striking - it rolls right off the tongue yet the imagery, warm and complex, lingers on. It is so strange yet so familiar that I just cannot turn my thoughts away; this might be my favorite piece of (unironic) neural network literary work to date. Norman reminded me of them again as he peacefully napped, leaning gently on me.

### Feb. 12 - the portal

![solder]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/5-6.jpg' | relative_url }})
*fixed some broken LEDs for mars. Thanks [Dan](https://www.danioved.com/) and [Sofy](https://soniayuditskaya.tumblr.com/) for teaching me how to solder!*

At mars: the ITP crew turned on all the TVs at the portal! The installation, calibration, and power supply all took a lot of effort to be figured out, so it was a triumphant moment for the people who has been working so hard on this project.

### Feb. 15-19 - parties and nature

This week went by in a wirlwind of endless celebration & travels.

### Feb. 22 - neon colors
Today I took a lot of photos with neon colors.

![sheverb]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/7-1.jpg' | relative_url }})
*[Sheverb](https://sheverb.bandcamp.com/), the residence band at [BBAC](http://www.growersfirst.org/bbaccenter.html) this month, plays their new album at ski inn.*

Fantastic femme-led instrumental surf rock; I recommend you to check them out. 

After the show, We roamed around the town.

### Feb. 23 - double feature
mars double feature night strikes again.

*thank you unicyle for being a loyal friend and an awesome speaker <3*


### Feb. 24-25 - mars work station & karaoke of dreams

One day over dinner, [Derek](https://www.instagram.com/dxkzh/), [Sofy](https://www.instagram.com/_the_s0urce_/), and I have came together to decide that we would like to build an AI-generated karaoke booth in the middle of the desert. I will be working on its software for the next couple of days, and you can find the code [here](https://github.com/guiguiguiguigui/karaoke).

At sunset I went to mars. As I got to mars I found out that a brand new workspace was built on the side of Pegasus, our shipping container.

![outside]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/9-3.jpg' | relative_url }})
*allunimum sheets FTW*

![inside]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/9-1.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Beutiful, shiny, and just the right amount of shade.*

![inside]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/9-2.jpg' | relative_url }})
*We even have a kitchen space! Alsino cooking.*

Mars is starting to feel like a real hub now, a place we can live and work in.

Maybe even more notable is that Sofy built this majestic tesseract in one day. Is she real?

![sofy and the tesseract]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/9-4.jpg' | relative_url }})
*This tesseract will be housing our desert dream karaoke.*

### Feb. 26 - Espen

[Espen](https://www.instagram.com/eppiepeppie/) is leaving us soon. Durring his time here, in addition to being a remarkable human, he trained a VAE on faces and built this lovely installation. 

![espen]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/10-1.jpeg' | relative_url }})
*The artist examining his creation*

![bombaydreams]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/10-2.jpg' | relative_url }})
*morphed faces. picture by espen.*

The TVs show Brahmannauts' portraits being interpreted by a neural network, which applies style transfer to morph the faces into artwokes at Bombay Beach. You can read more about _Bombay Dreaming_ [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9UkuAqF_8v/) and [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@brahman/s/brahman/projects/bombay-dreaming).

It was an honor to be there to celebrate the finish of this piece. I'm familiar with images generated by GANs (and my opinion is that artworks created by them are often unintersting), but it's cool to see them being given physicality. The fact that they are played on hotel-renovation TVs, lying in hand-crafted frames carved into the middle of a desert is in itself provocative about people's relationship with technology and the enviornment. (and also, the piece is about people I like and care about...) I think it's quite clever and lovely. 

![Espen]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/10-3.jpeg' | relative_url }})
*Thank you espen!*

### Feb. 29 - collective intellegence lab

I arrived just in time from san diego to be at gene's collective intellegence lab. High winds on mars cuased a night sandstorm, but in some sense it was the perfect backdrop to learn / hear a pitch about an autonomous AI artist.

### Mar. 1 - unicycle repair

![unicycle]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/11-1.jpeg' | relative_url }})
*cracked open a good boy to replace the batteries*

In other news, Sofy's tesseract now has a inner chamber! The smaller one will house the electronics and the screen for the karaoke.

*sofy is a genius and her creations are majestic*

### Mar. 2 - windstorm

![wind]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/12-1.gif' | relative_url }})
*high winds on mars & flying parts*
{: style="width: 60%;" class="center"}

The wind disrupted our plan to work on our computers on mars. Instead, we went into Gene's RV and he supplied us with delicious omlets and good conversations.

### Mar. 5 - bouldering workshop
[Alsino](https://alsino.io/) and [Paul](https://www.instagram.com/paul_tootoot_/) updated the climbing wall and gave a bouldering workshop. The only record I have of it was during warmup:
