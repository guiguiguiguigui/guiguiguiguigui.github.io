## The Town
I'm at Bombay Beach for [brahman.ai](https://brahman.ai), [Gene](https://genekogan.com)'s initiative for living and learning in the californian desert. I came here with the intention to [write about ml](https://ml4a.github.io) and to build robots.

Bombay Beach is maybe best known by its [Biennale](http://www.bombaybeachbiennale.org), a town-wide art festival with tints of post-apocalyptic aesthetics. The Biennalie's artifacts resonate really well with the people and landscape here, making BB a crusty, magical-realist, and overall very charming town. 

I'd love to give you a little tour here, but that has to wait until I develop & scan my films. For now, here's a sneak peek.

Finishing the day with a great sunset over the RVs.

### Feb.9 - storm-proofing mars

Mars is another Brahman site in the desert east of Bombay Beach. The structures shown below is _portal_ (a glimpse into the building process [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7eYyg0Ba1K/)), in which we plan to host a party next Saturday.

&nbsp;

The evening's work was to protect the structure and the 48 TVs inside it. The TVs were donated by a hotel in Manhattan after its renovation. These pictures were taken on the second day, as we were rushing to cover as many area possible before sundown.

### Feb.10 - 3d printing and network security

The storm alert turned out to be a false alarm, but I nonetheless stayed in and learned to do some 3D printing from [Alejandro](https://github.com/alejandrosame).

Who doesn't want to learn about network security and incidence response on a Monday night? With the d20s, we played two rounds of [b&b](http://www.backdoorsandbreaches.com/). 


### Feb.11 - norman and sunset spins

![norman]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/4-1.jpg' | relative_url }})
*Breaking news: Norman napped next to me today*

At the [machine creativity workshop](https://neurips2019creativity.github.io/) at NeurIPS 2019, the band YACHT recited some lyrics from their new album, [Chain Tripping](https://yacht.bandcamp.com/album/chain-tripping). They worked with [Ross Goodwin](https://rossgoodwin.com) and used (my guess is) an recurrent neural net to generate the melodies and lyrics, picked and stitched from these materials, and created a production that (well deservedly) received a Grammy nomination. Anyway, these few lines were stuck in my head for the months that followed, and I want to share them with you. 

> I’m so in love I can feel it in my car  
> I  can feel it in my heart  
> I  can feel it so hard  
> (...)  
> 
> Oh,  won't you come, won't you come  
> Won’t you work on my head  
> Be  my number nine 
>  
> To be alive, to be with you, like a weed  
> 
> I can feel it in my head  
> Like a dog in bed
{: class="smaller"}

The last two lines is striking - it rolls off the tongue so nicely yet the imagery, warm and complex, lingers on. It is so strange yet so familiar that I just cannot turn my thoughts away; this might be my favorite piece of unironic neural network literary work to date. Norman reminded me of them again when he leaned on me and peacefully napped.

### Feb. 12 - the portal


![solder]({{ '/assets/img/bbd/5-6.jpg' | relative_url }})
*fixed some broken LEDs for mars. Thanks [Dan](https://www.danioved.com/) and [Sofy](https://soniayuditskaya.tumblr.com/) for teaching me how to solder!*

At mars: the ITP crew turned on all the TVs at the portal! The installation, calibration, and power supply all took a lot of effort to be figured out, so it was a triumphant moment for the people who has been working so hard on this project.
