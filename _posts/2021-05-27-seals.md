*our poster for NIME 2021*

You can read the paper [here](https://nime.pubpub.org/pub/5oupvoun/draft?access=jhkokrol) and listen to our music [here](https://the5eals.bandcamp.com/album/the-seals-holiday-special).

This paper documents the music-making of the band _Seals_, for which I play bass and do machine learning. The Seals is a pet project with Margaret Schedel, Susie Green, Ria Rajan, and Sofy Yuditskaya; we introduce ourselves, (cheekly), as _a political, feminist, noise, and AI-inspired electronic sorta-surf rock band_. The S.E.A.L. (Synthetic Erudition Assist Lattice) is the collection of algorithms that assist us in creating content with which to mold and shape our music and visuals. Glad to see our acronym powers from academia came into use.

Our first collection of songs are about how our living experiences are mediated by technology, pandemic lockdowns, the female body, and the occult.  I hope we can bring a performance to you one day.
